#### Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI), usable security and privacy, dark pattern detection, and emerging technologies. Currently, I'm investigating the gaps between privacy design methods and users' understandings of privacy notices, control mechanisms, and data flow. I'm also dedicated to creating innovative interfaces that improve user privacy experiences in computing systems and emerging technology contexts.

My ongoing work involves designing privacy notices specifically for emerging technology sectors. Previously, I've worked on projects including the development of AI Conversational Agent systems and conducting studies involving role-playing games.
